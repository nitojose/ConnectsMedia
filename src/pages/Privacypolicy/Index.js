        <p>ConnectMedia Networks is a digital marketing platform headquartered in Colorado City. We are providing this services privacy policy to inform you about how our technology platform and related services (collectively, “Services”) process information on behalf of online advertisers, website owners, data providers and other entities that use our Services.</p>
        <p>ConnectMedia Networks runs a technology buying platform for digital media marketing. The ConnectMedia Networks technology allows our customers to buy social media management and SEO services. When the service is bought or sold our technology fulfills the transaction by delivering the digital creatives like image posters, motion graphics and video (collectively, "Creatives") to Internet users who visit the respective social media websites. </p>
        <p>The ConnectMedia Networks Services are intended primarily for use by institutions like Christian Missionaries and Churches. We may also collect personal information from individuals who visit our websites, interact with our marketing messages and emails, or engage with us about career opportunities with ConnectMedia Networks.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@connectmedianetworks.com">privacy@connectmedianetworks.com</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>Privacy Practices for Our Technology</h3>
        <p>Advertising supports the free content and digital user experiences that we all love. Our goal is to make advertising more effective by helping our customers to display Creatives that may be of interest to you as a site user or visitor or as a registered member. We believe that relevant Creatives are more valuable to users than less relevant ads. More relevance also helps the services that depend on advertising because advertisers pay more for effective ads, which in turn leads to higher quality and richer consumer experiences.</p>
        <!--<p>ConnectMedia Networks adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), the European Principles published by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA), and the Self-Regulatory Principles published by the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC). We honor the DAA’s, CDAA’s, and EDAA’s opt-out mechanisms for data collection and use in connection with mobile applications..</p>//-->
        <h3 id="what-information">What Information We Collect, The Purpose of Collection and Use</h3>

This information may include data like contact name, organisation information, logo, contact details, marketing materials, login credentials for social media websites, hosting credentials for accessing webserver and token access to share files via google drive.</p>
        
        <h3>Contact Information</h3>
        <p>We collect contact information through our technology from customers, who wish to obtain information or support, or to obtain access to our platform. Contact information includes: first name, last name, email address, name of the organization, country, state/region and phone numbers. This contact information is used by our sales, support and operations teams to contact our customers for the purpose of providing the requested information or support, communicate via email regarding our current and future offerings, and/or provide and receive feedback on our Services.</p>
        
        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>Like most organizations, we rely on automatic data collection technology to collect information such as your IP host address, Internet service provider, browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, number of links you click, search terms, and other data. We use this data to analyze the use of and improve our Services.</p>
               
        <h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
        <p>Cookies are small packets of data that are stored on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visits to websites or your viewing of ads. If you do not want us or our service providers to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off in your browser or device settings.</p>
              
        <h3>Information We Receive from Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We may also receive information about you from third parties when you interact with third party sites or apps. We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with the information we directly collect from you and use such information in accordance with this services privacy policy and requirements under applicable data protection and privacy laws.</p>

        <h3>Onward Transfer to Third Parties</h3>
        <p>ConnectMedia Networks may share your information with its customers in connection with the offering of its Services. For example, a ConnectMedia Networks customer may receive a log of all creatives they served through our platform with data about your cookie and mobile advertising identifiers that interacted with the ads, including IP host addresses and other pseudonymous information in non-aggregated form. When we know the user or the ad request is subject to GDPR, any personal data for which a separate consent has not been received are pseudonymized (one-way hashed) before being shared with customers and are sufficiently protected as required by GDPR (see below for more information about how we handle the transfer of data outside the EEA).</p>
        <p>Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose personal information to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal information in support of our Services and their functions are: data analytics vendors, data hosting providers, optimization vendors, and document hosting and support services providers. All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this privacy policy and implemented by ConnectMedia Networks. You may have the right to opt out of having your personal information transferred to any or all of our categories of agents by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@connectmedianetworks.com">privacy@connectmedianetworks.com</a>. Please allow us a reasonable time to process your request.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong>. In the event of a merger, dissolution or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such information as set forth in this services privacy policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Disclosure to Public Authorities</strong>. We are required to disclose the information that we have collected in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.</p>
        
        <h3>Access to Personal Information</h3>
        <p>Upon receipt of a verifiable request to <a href="mailto:privacy@connectmedianetworks.com">privacy@connectmedianetworks.com</a>, we will provide you with confirmation as to whether we are processing your personal information, and where we are the controller of such data, we will have it communicated to you within a reasonable time. In cases where we are acting as a service provider to our customers, we are a data processor, and we do not directly control any personal data, so any changes or inaccuracies in the data we collect should be addressed to the businesses that are the controllers of such data. Please allow us a reasonable time to respond to your inquiries and requests.</p>
        
        <h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>

        <h3>Children</h3>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 (or higher age where required by applicable law) through the platform. If you are under 13 (or higher age where required by applicable law), please do not give us any personal information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our privacy policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information to us without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 (or higher age where applicable) has provided personal information to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@connectmedianetworks.com">privacy@connectmedianetworks.com</a>, and we will act on your request as required by applicable laws.</p>
        
        <h3>Links to External Websites</h3>
        <p>The ConnectMedia Networks technology may contain links to third party websites, content and services (“External Sites”). Where ConnectMedia Networks has relationships with such third parties, we use reasonable efforts to require our customers and partners to treat the personal information we share with them in accordance with applicable laws, the terms of any contracts we may have with them, and their own privacy policies, but otherwise we cannot control their use of this information. Where we have no such relationship, we are not responsible for the privacy policies of those External Sites or their use of personal information. You should check the applicable third party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any External Sites, and before providing any personal information to such External Sites.</p>

        <p>We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
        <p>We commit to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) to address any privacy-related complaints from you. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your privacy-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact the EU DPAs for more information or to file a complaint. The services of EU DPAs are provided at no cost to you.</p>
