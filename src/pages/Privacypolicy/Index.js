        <h3>Privacy Practices for Our Technology</h3>
        <p>Advertising supports the free content and digital user experiences that we all love. Our goal is to make advertising more effective by helping our customers to display ads that may be of interest to you. We believe that relevant ads are more valuable to users than less relevant ads. More relevance also helps the services that depend on advertising because advertisers pay more for effective ads, which in turn leads to higher quality and richer consumer experiences.</p>
        <p>ConnectMedia Networks is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and we adhere to the NAI Codes of Conduct. To learn more about the NAI and the Code of Conduct please visit: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code">http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code</a>.</p>
        <p>ConnectMedia Networks adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), the European Principles published by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA), and the Self-Regulatory Principles published by the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC). We honor the DAA’s, CDAA’s, and EDAA’s opt-out mechanisms for data collection and use in connection with mobile applications..</p>
        
        <h3 id="what-information"></h3>What Information We Collect, The Purpose of Collection and Use
        <p>The ConnectMedia Networks technology collects information on behalf of its customers to help target online advertising to you based on your interests. This information may include cookie and mobile advertising identifiers, your IP host address (which we truncate when we know the user or the ad request is subject to GDPR), your browser type (e.g. Chrome or Firefox), the date and time of the ad request, advertiser pages viewed, your operating system (e.g. Macintosh, Windows, Android, OSX), the URL or App you are using, and your Internet Service Provider (e.g. Verizon or Comcast).</p>
        
        <h3>Contact Information</h3>
        <p>We collect contact information through our technology from customers, vendors and distributors who wish to obtain information or support, or to obtain access to our platform. Contact information includes: first name, last name, email address, job title, name of the organization, country, state/region and phone numbers (cell and/or landline). This contact information is used by our sales, support and operations teams to contact our customers, vendors and distributors for the purpose of providing the requested information or support, communicate via email regarding our current and future offerings, and/or provide and receive feedback on our Services.</p>
        
        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>Like most organizations, we rely on automatic data collection technology to collect information such as your IP host address, Internet service provider, browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, number of links you click, search terms, and other data. We use this data to analyze the use of and improve our Services.</p>
        
        <h3>Mobile Tracking</h3>
        <p>To provide relevant ads to users on mobile devices we may also collect the following mobile specific information: device type, make and model, operating system, mobile advertising identifiers, operating system device identifier (For example, IDFA for iOS and Android ID for Android) and information about the apps you use. We may also use the GPS location of your device if you have opted-in to provide it to one of the publishers or ad exchanges who make digital advertising inventory available through the Services as further described below under "Location Tracking."</p>
        <p>Your iOS mobile device may provide a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting and other settings that allow you to control the data that applications may use for location and interest-based advertising. On Android devices, your settings may allow you to “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads.” When you have opted out using this setting on a device and that information is passed to ConnectMedia Networks, ConnectMedia Networks will not use your unique device identifier to target ads to you or place you in segments for future marketing.</p>
        
        <h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
        <p>Cookies are small packets of data that are stored on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visits to websites or your viewing of ads. If you do not want us or our service providers to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off in your browser or device settings.</p>
              
        <h3>Information We Receive from Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We may also receive information about you from third parties when you interact with third party sites or apps. We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with the information we directly collect from you and use such information in accordance with this services privacy policy and requirements under applicable data protection and privacy laws.</p>
        
        <h3>Use of Cross-Device Linking</h3>
        <p>ConnectMedia Networks may offer cross-device linking services to our customers. These services attempt to identify which identifiers are associated with the same user across multiple devices, such as between a desktop computer and a mobile device. To enable these services, we may, subject to the section on <a href="#onward">Onward Transfer to Third Parties</a>, share your pseudonymised information with contracted third parties that provide cross-device linking services. For consumers who have opted-out from the use of your personal information by ConnectMedia Networks, we do not share any of your information with these third parties and do not attempt to re-identify the user in any way. We do not utilize cross-device linking services when we know the user or the ad request is subject to GDPR or otherwise not permitted. To effectively opt-out of our cross-device linking services, users must opt-out on every device and browser using our opt-out methods described in the <a href="#cookies">Cookies</a> section of this policy, including in the section on Mobile Tracking.</p>
        
        <div id="onward"></div>
        
        <h3>Onward Transfer to Third Parties</h3>
        <p>ConnectMedia Networks may share your information with its customers in connection with the offering of its Services. For example, a ConnectMedia Networks customer may receive a log of all ads they served through our platform with data about your cookie and mobile advertising identifiers that interacted with the ads, including IP host addresses and other pseudonymous information in non-aggregated form. When we know the user or the ad request is subject to GDPR, any personal data for which a separate consent has not been received are pseudonymized (one-way hashed) before being shared with customers and are sufficiently protected as required by GDPR (see below for more information about how we handle the transfer of data outside the EEA).</p>
        <p>Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose personal information to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal information in support of our Services and their functions are: data analytics vendors, data hosting providers, optimization vendors, and document hosting and support services providers. All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this privacy policy and implemented by ConnectMedia Networks. You may have the right to opt out of having your personal information transferred to any or all of our categories of agents by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@connectmedianetworks.com">privacy@connectmedianetworks.com</a>. Please allow us a reasonable time to process your request.</p>
        <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong>. In the event of a merger, dissolution or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such information as set forth in this services privacy policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Disclosure to Public Authorities</strong>. We are required to disclose the information that we have collected in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.</p>
        
        <h3>Access to Personal Information</h3>

        <h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>

Accordingly, we will implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
        
        <h3>Children</h3>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 (or higher age where required by applicable law) through the platform. If you are under 13 (or higher age where required by applicable law), please do not give us any personal information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our privacy policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information to us without their permission.

        <h3>Links to External Websites</h3>
        <p>The ConnectMedia Networks technology may contain links to third party websites, content and services (“External Sites”). Where ConnectMedia Networks has relationships with such third parties, we use reasonable efforts to require our customers and partners to treat the personal information we share with them in accordance with applicable laws, the terms of any contracts we may have with them, and their own privacy policies, but otherwise we cannot control their use of this information. Where we have no such relationship, we are not responsible for the privacy policies of those External Sites or their use of personal information. You should check the applicable third party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any External Sites, and before providing any personal information to such External Sites.</p>
        
        <h3>Important Notice to All Non-US Residents</h3>
        <p>Our computer servers that store personal information for our Services may be located in the US. If you are located outside of the US, please be aware that any information provided to us, including personal information, will be transferred from your country of origin to and processed in the US. We comply with all applicable laws to protect the security of data during international transfer, for instance by using EC standard contractual clauses and appropriate supplementary measures when a transfer is made to a third party country that is not considered adequate by the EU Commission or the UK.</p>
        <p>We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
        <p>We commit to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) to address any privacy-related complaints from you. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your privacy-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact the EU DPAs for more information or to file a complaint. The services of EU DPAs are provided at no cost to you.</p>

        <h3>Lawful Basis for EU Data Processing</h3>
        <p>We process personal data in several ways, each with respect for the privacy rights of individuals. When we are acting either as the data controller or data processor for our customers, we rely on the following lawful bases for our processing:</p>

          <li><u>Data Subject Consent</u>.
